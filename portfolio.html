<h1>MY EXPERIENSES</h1>
<img src = "logo-1.png"/>
<p>My School Experience I think school experience is individual and for many reasons. Mine had good points, rough points and moments where I couldn’t function to even attend. They don’t have the same services that they do now as when I was in school. Many people believe that school prepares you for life and your future. I always felt like school was a place to put kids but didn’t really prepare them for the realities of life. I wouldn’t say my school experience was bad, I just always felt bored. The kids seemed to be very immature and that annoyed me the further along into school I went. I was active in sports and got good enough grades to play but I didn’t enjoy school. I always felt like I wanted to get out and experience life. I have not only been a public school student but a parent of a special needs child and an employee. My background gives me the ability to see the faculty, parent and student views as well as find a middle ground when trying to mediate concerns and problems.  My child was special needs and placed in a self-contained room for several years. My concern about that type of placement would be not making the child feel marginalized or labeled and the negative consequences that can bring.  However I do believe that they have benefits if the child needs them.  I most difficult experience I had was dealing with being raped and telling no one while trying to still function. I think mostly because the prevailing theme of the time was that you somehow deserved
